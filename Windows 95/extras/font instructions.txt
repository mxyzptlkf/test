This procedure was inspired by the one outlined here: https://github.com/grassmunk/Chicago95/blob/master/INSTALL.md#ms_sans_serif

1. Acquire a copy of the Tahoma font (regular and bold) from a Windows installation. It can be found in C:\WINDOWS\Fonts (filenames tahoma.ttf and tahomabd.ttf). You can also use MS Sans Serif, which is the font that was actually used in Windows 95. 

2. Open tahoma.ttf in FontForge and press Ctrl+Shift+B to open the bitmap strikes dialog.

3. Select "Win" and type 8 under "Point sizes on a 96 dpi screen" and then press OK. Make sure "Create Rasterized Strikes" is checked.

4. Press Ctrl+Shift+F to open the Font Info menu.

5. In order to not overlap with existing fonts, the name should be changed to something unique. For the sake of simplicity, I suggest setting the same names I did as that's how the theme is configured:
    Fontname: Tahoma8ptRegular
    Family name: Tahoma8pt
    Name for humans: Tahoma 8pt Regular
    Weight: Regular

6. Press OK. A dialog box will open asking to change the UniqueID or XUID. Press "Change".

7. Export the font by pressing Ctrl+Shift+G. Make sure the options "No Outline Font" and "(faked) MS bitmap only" are selected under the file name, then press "Generate". You may now close FontForge without saving.

8. Repeat the same procedure for tahomabd.ttf, using the following values in the Font Info menu:
    Fontname: Tahoma8ptBold
    Family name: Tahoma8pt
    Name for humans: Tahoma 8pt Bold
    Weight: Bold
    
9. Place the exported .ttf files in $HOME/.fonts or /usr/share/fonts

Keep in mind, if you intend to use a different font, you must update the default.theme file for it to take effect.
